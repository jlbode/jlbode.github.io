        <p justify ="left">The objective was to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.
            So as to not schew results, the longitude and latidude were randomly selected for each observations, using 
            values that spanned the entire globe. Since many locations are not cities, the name and location of the nearest city 
            was identified using CityPy, a library with has a method for identifying the city closest to a location.
            Subsequently, I performed a series of successive API calls to OpenWeather to pull the most recent weather.<br>
            <br>
            Because so much of the earth is covered in Ocean, quite often the closest cities turned out to be coastal, with many of them
            far north or far south. Duplicates were quite common and were removed. <br>

        <div class="col-md-3">  
            <p justify ="left">To better understand where the data was coming from, I used Python gmaps to plot 
                the location of the cities. I used a heatmap to asses if the cities were clustered. As one would 
                expect a heatmap is hotter (more red) when lots of locations are clustered together and colder (greener) when
                the locations are dispersed. I added popups to provide information about specific observations<br>
                The cities in the map were predominantly coastal. However, it was still unclear if we ended up with 
                distorted results simply because most of the population in the world lives in coastal areas. The final list of cities
                was a plausible representation of cities worldwide. Perhaps the most important finding was 
                that we had ample variation in longitudes, with cities at different distances both north and south of the equator.
